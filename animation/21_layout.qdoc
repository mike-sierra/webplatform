==The Mobile Viewport==

Applying a ''viewport'' is the first and most important step to make
web pages presentable on mobile browsers.

Touch-based smartphone browsers are capable of presenting web pages
designed for desktop browsers, but the experience needs improvement.
When loading full-sized pages, mobile browsers display the entire page
at reduced magnification. Users must double-tap or pinch the screen to
magnify individual columns of content. Even then, text sized for
full-sized browsers is often difficult to read. The following shows
how a typical web page layout displays:

[[Image:viewport_fail1.png]]
[[Image:viewport_fail2.png]]
[[Image:viewport_fail3.png]]

Users are obliged to go through several steps before text becomes
legible, in this case including tipping the handset to increase the
column's magnification. When users reach the end of the column, they
often experience difficulty reorienting themselves within the page.

The fixed rectangular area within which touch-based smartphone
browsers display larger web pages is called the ''viewport''.
Applying a viewport '''meta''' tag allows you to control how mobile
browsers render content within this rectangle, and whether users can
use magnification controls.

The following shows a sample screen layout without a viewport. The
initially loaded page is zoomed out too far to be legible, while
zooming in makes content extending off the right edge of the screen
relatively inacessible:

[[Image:view_off.PNG]]

This reflects the browser's default assumption that content should
extend 980 pixels wide.

'''Note:''' This sample layout displays a [[flexibly
positioned]] element that adapts to the full width of the screen,
along with a fixed-size [[background image]].

To correct this behavior, place the following line within the HTML's
'''head''' region:

<pre>
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
</pre>

The following shows the screen layout after the above viewport is
applied:

[[Image:view_on.PNG]]

Setting the '''width''' to '''device-width''' recalculates flexible CSS
measurements (such as '''width:100%''') within the width of the
handset's screen rather than the default page width. (Tipping the
handset maintains the overall width of the content within the wider
window.)

On a majority of touch-based mobile browsers, the '''device-width''' is
320 pixels. make sure images and other fixed-dimension elements are
sized accordingly. The screen height varies significantly among
devices, and increases for [[full-screen web
apps]] that suppress the browser's native screen controls.

'''Note:''' Applying a viewport has no effect on desktop browsers. It is
interpreted only once when the page loads, and cannot be modified
thereafter.

==Constraining Touch Response==

Applying the above viewport forces content to scroll downward, though
it can still extend horizontally or be positioned outside the screen.
By default, horizontal panning is disabled when the content fits
within the viewport. (A similar '''height=device-height''' property may
also resize content, but does not disable vertical panning to navigate
to overflowing content.)

'''Note:''' CSS's '''translate()''' transform function offers the best way to stage
hidden interface elements off the edge of the screen, since it is a
more superficial visual effect that doesn't modify the dimensions of
the overall content within the page. (See [[Transforms]] for
details.)

Once content is well-adapted and accessible for presentation on mobile
browsers, there may no longer be any need to use zoom controls to
access different portions of the page. To disable the browser's
default double-tap and pinch-zoom gestures and ensure that content
appears at the proper magnification level, apply the following
viewport:

<pre>
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no" />
</pre>

As an alternative to disabling scaling, you can apply decimal
'''minimum-scale''' and '''maximum-scale''' values to control the
potential ''range'' of magnification. See [[Tipping the Handset]] for
details on how these viewport options and related CSS affects the
appearance of landscape-oriented content.

'''Note:''' The '''user-scalable''' property only affects access to the overall
page.  [[touch-enabled web content]] within that page
such as map interfaces may still respond independently to pinch-zoom
and drag-scroll gestures.

To disable vertical scrolling, you need to make sure there is not so
much content on each page that it would overflow the screen. Screen
layouts may also explicitly disable vertical scrolling, but they do so
simply by making any overflowing content inaccessible. The following
viewport-enabled example presents a full-screen '''section''' element
whose dimensions align with each edge of the screen:

<pre>
<head>
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
<style>
section {
    position: absolute; top:0; bottom:0; left:0; right:0;
    overflow: hidden;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
  <section>
  ...
  </section>
</body>
</pre>

'''Note:''' Even if content overflows the screen without being hidden, setting
the following CSS renders it inaccessible:

<pre>
body { overflow: hidden }
</pre>

Increasingly, mobile browsers allow users to navigate scrollable
content elements that appear within a page, but these should be used
with care. Users may become confused when the scrolling gestures they
expect to scroll within a page instead scrolls within a narrow region
of that page. See [[Scrollbars]] for an example of a way to use
familiar tap gestures to access content that scrolls off the side of
the screen. Overall, avoid presenting content such as wide tables
that oblige users to scroll horizontally. An example [[introduced earlier]] demonstrates how tabular data may
be arranged vertically on the smaller screen and presented one row at
a time:

[[Image:scr_layout_tbl-keyhole.png]]

Re-styling the '''display''' of table cells as '''block''' overrides
their default horizontal arrangement.

'''Note:''' Screen layout should be driven entirely by CSS properties. HTML table
elements should be used only for tabular data, and never to arrange
elements on the screen. Likewise, do not use the deprecated
'''frameset''' tag to define layouts that indirectly reference other
HTML files. Both of these older web layout techniques render poorly on
mobile browsers.

==Flexible Positioning==

After applying a [[viewport]], CSS-based page
layout allows designs to flexibly adapt to different screen
dimensions. This section demonstrates how the CSS '''position'''
property can be used effectively for most screen layout.

The following example shows a typical mobile layout, with navigation
icons placed at the top of the screen, and a vertically flexible
content area:

[[Image:scr_layout_nav.png]]

The main '''section''' panel relies on '''position:absolute''', with
''em'' units offsetting it from the '''left''', '''right''', and '''top'''
of the screen. To account for overflowing content, the bottom edge is
allowed to expand past the element's default '''min-height'''. Its
generous bottom '''margin''' clearly marks the end of the content.

In this example, text overflows the bottom edge of the screen, which
forces the fixed navigation items off the top of the screen. (The
button at the bottom of the page is offered as a convenience to allow
users to jump back to the top to access other navigation options.)  To
address this accessibility problem, the '''position:fixed''' property
allows navigation elements to remain on the screen regardless of
scrolling.

The following example repositions the navigation items at the bottom
of the screen, offset using a percentage to account for potential
variation in screen height. The main content area still uses
'''position:absolute''' as described above, but the navigation area uses
'''position:fixed''' to keep it on the screen at all times:

[[Image:scr_layout_nav_fixed.png]]
[[Image:scr_layout_nav_fixed2.png]]

This example is defined as a [[full-screen
application]]. The customary browser controls are removed from the
bottom of the screen, which allows the application to use that space.
Placing controls at the bottom of the screen allows users to control
the application using one hand. Since navigation controls are always
available in this example, there is no longer any need to provide a
link back to the top of each page.

Despite its usefulness, the '''position:fixed''' property is not yet
widely deployed among mobile browsers. The
[[Modernizr]] JavaScript plug-in offers a
comprehensive suite of browser feature detection tests, including a
[[method to test support for
'''position:fixed''']]. As an added benefit, Modernizr extends CSS so
that classes such as '''.no-positionfixed''' can define a set of
fallback style sheets. Some JavaScript plug-ins such as
[[Cubiq's
iScroll]] and [[Sencha Touch]]
emulate '''position:fixed''' by defining a screen region that uses touch
events to mimic the browser's default scrolling behavior. (Mobile
browsers customarily respond with a bounce effect when you hit the
edge of a scrollable area, and allow quick ''flick'' gestures to keep
content scrolling after the finger lifts from the screen.)

Browsers that do not implement '''position:fixed''' respond by applying
'''position:absolute''', which may serve as a fallback. The following
example uses a single expandable icon to access many different
navigation options, implemented as accordion lists:

[[Image:scr_anim_accord1.png]]
[[Image:scr_anim_accord2.png]]
[[Image:scr_anim_accord3.png]]
[[Image:scr_anim_accord4.png]]

On supporting browsers, this icon always appears at the same point on
the screen regardless of scroll state, but otherwise it scrolls away
harmlessly.

See [[Animations]] for more information on how to implement the
navigation icon's two-stage transition.

==Flexible Boxes==

This section introduces Level 3 CSS ''flexible box'' properties, which
may serve as an alternative to positioning in mobile screen layouts.

The following example reproduces the full-screen layout featuring
bottom-aligned navigation controls:

[[Image:scr_layout_nav_flex.png]]
[[Image:scr_layout_nav_flex2.png]]

The basic markup is structured as follows:

<pre>
<body>
  <section>
    <nav>
      <a href="#"></a>
      <a href="#"></a>
      <a href="#"></a>
      <a href="#"></a>
      <a href="#"></a>
      <a href="#"></a>
    </nav>
    <article>
      <!-- main content -->
    </article>
  </section>
</body>
</pre>

To enable flexible box properties, the full-screen '''section''' is
defined as a '''box''' rather than the default '''block'''. The
'''box-orient''' property determines how nested child elements are to be
visually arranged within the box:

<pre>
section {
    display            : -webkit-box;
    -webkit-box-orient : vertical;
}
</pre>

The '''nav''' element uses the default ''inflexible'' formatting,
wrapping around the navigation icons with no extra spacing. The
'''article''' element, however is set to be ''flexible'', which allows
it to expand tp fill unused screen area:

<pre>
article {
    -webkit-box-flex   : 1;
}
</pre>

The ''flexibility'' of boxes is expressed in relative terms. Relative
to the '''nav''' element, the '''article''' is fully flexible, so it
fills all the remaining space not taken up by the '''nav'''
element. (If there were another element with a '''box-flex''' of '''2''',
it would take up twice the available area as the '''article'''.)

Note that the '''nav''' element is defined first within the markup,
but appears below the '''article''' on the screen. The
'''box-ordinal-group''' property overrides the default arrangement of
boxes, in this case making the '''nav''' appear second:

<pre>
nav {
    -webkit-box-ordinal-group : 2;
}
</pre>

Another way to do this would be to reverse the direction in which
child elements appear:

<pre>
section {
    -webkit-box-direction : reverse;
}
</pre>

The '''nav''' element is itself set to display as a '''box''':

<pre>
nav {
    display                   : -webkit-box;
    -webkit-box-orient        : horizontal;
    -webkit-box-pack          : justify;
}
</pre>

The '''box-orient''' property arranges nested navigation elements
horizontally, and the '''box-pack''' property distributes them evenly
within the available space. (This improves upon the
[[previous version of the layout]], which used
text justification to distribute the icons.)

'''Note:''' CSS's flexible box properties are more widely supported than
'''position:fixed''', but overflowing content has to be implemented as
scrollable regions, which may not always perform as smoothly as
scrolling within an entire page. On iPhone Safari, setting
'''-webkit-overflow-scroll:touch''' makes scrollable regions perform as
well as full-page scrolling. See [[Scrollbars]] for information on
how to suppress the appearance of scrollbars while keeping content
scrollable.

The following example uses flexible box properties and animation to
highlight selected images:

[[Image:scr_css3_flex.png]]

==Box Sizing==

The [[examples above]] use absolute positioning
to make layout elements snap to both the left and right edges of the
screen. Elements specified as '''width:100%''' can also be made to fill
the screen.

However, there has long been ambiguity among browsers in how an
element's dimensions are measured. By default, WebKit-based browsers
do not incorporate padding and borders into such measurements, which
often leads to unexpected results. To address this problem, Level 3
CSS includes a '''box-sizing''' property that allows designers to
specify how to apply measurements.

The following example illustrates how failure to specify
'''box-sizing''' may adversely affect screen layout:

[[Image:scr_layout_boxsizing.png]]
[[Image:scr_layout_boxsizing2.png]]

The '''section''' element that contains navigation elements, hilighted
here with a border, is defined with a '''width''' of '''100%''' and a
'''height''' of '''6em'''. The default '''box-sizing''' is '''content-box'''.
Unless it is set to '''border-box''', measurements only apply to the
interior content, not to the element's full width. In this case, it
means the element doesn't fit within the screen, and becomes much
taller than intended.

'''Note:''' Despite its name, '''box-sizing''' applies to all block elements, not
just to flexible '''box''' elements [[described above]].

==Semantic Tags==

The examples above use various HTML5 ''semantic'' tags to define
high-level regions of the page. These tags serve as a clearer
alternative to more abstract block '''div''' and inline '''span'''
elements that don't reference what kind of content they encapsulate.

None of these semantic tags is required, but they help standardize
overall information design, and may help search engines assign
relevance to content. Except for the '''mark''' tag, they are not
presented with any default styling.

Block-level semantic tags include:

* '''section''': Major groupings of content within a page. For example,
separate sections for main content and for user comments.

* '''article''': The main item of interest within a page or section.

* '''figure''': An image relevant to content within a page, as opposed
to a background design element or an image featured within an
advertisement.

* '''figcaption''': Text describing a '''figure'''.

* '''nav''': Regions reserved for groups of navigation links.

* '''header''': Regions of site-wide banner elements such as logos,
search boxes, and navigation elements.

* '''footer''': Regions of site-wide elements, such as legal notices or
contact links, that are not as prominent as '''header''' elements, and
typically appear at the bottom of the page.

* '''aside''': Tangentially related content, such as highlighted
quotes, items of related interest, and advertisements.

* '''hgroup''': Typically a cluster of information about a heading. For
example, next to a standard heading tag providing the title of an
item, an '''hgroup''' might feature a related subtitle, author byline,
publication date, or a series of categories.

The following HTML5 tags are appropriate to apply semantic meaning to
in-line text:

* '''mark''': Highlighted text, for example to draw attention to search
terms within text. (Appears by default with a yellow background.)

* '''time''': Identifies when an item was published or updated.

* '''command''': Identifies text used to trigger an interface or other
process.

* '''output''': Like '''command''', but presents the result of an action.

Other newly introduced HTML5 tags offer more specialized
functionality. For example, '''progress''' and '''meter''' tags
represent the status of numeric data. See [[Input Types]] for more
information.

==XXX MT Viewport==

The Browser is capable of displaying web pages with complex
layouts that are targeted to desktop and laptop-sized screens. Users
can double-tap to zoom in on images or columns of text, and can drag
the screen around to navigate to items within a page that exceeds the
screen's dimensions.

However, viewing desktop-style content on a mobile device does not
offer users the best experience. Users spend far too much time and
effort panning and zooming around the large page layout, perhaps
re-orienting the device to landscape view to be able to read text. It
is much better to offer a mobile-optimized interface, which can be
[[deployed
along with a desktop-style interface]] if necessary.

When designing the page, specifying a ''viewport'' tells the browser
to fit design elements to the width of the mobile device, rather than
letting them extend to the default width sized for desktop-style
browsers. Add the following viewport specification to the HTML's
'''head''' region:

<pre>
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
</pre>

A single-column page such as the following ordinarily appears very
wide, but with the viewport enabled it conforms to the width of the
mobile screen, with no effect on desktop browsers:

<pre>
<head>
<style>
section { padding: 1em 1em 10em 1em; }
article {
    background: #fff;
    border-radius: 1em;
    padding: 1em;
    min-height: 70%;
}
h1 { text-align: center; }
</style>
</head>
<body>
<section>
<article>
<h1>viewport</h1>
...
</article>
</section>
</body>
</pre>

Here is how the page initially appears without a viewport:

[[Image: viewport_off.png]]

Here is how the page appears after the viewport is added:

[[Image:viewport_on.png]]

Note that to simulate the mobile viewport's appearance on
desktop-style browsers, the example above uses '''max-width''' CSS to
constrain the width of the page. It is not necessary to set the width
of the page in a mobile interface that has the viewport enabled.
