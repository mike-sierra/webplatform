<h1>Experiment: Adaptive Page Layout</h1>

<p>
Demo of adaptive page layout system that relies on CSS Regions to
thread content and uses Flexbox for layout. Features:
</p>

<ol>

<li>Main content flows through 2-column layout. (Y)

<li>Title appears in separate 1-column layout element. (N)

<li>New pages are added to flow overset content as needed. (Y)</li>

<li>Identifies figures, tables, code blocks, and asides as
"pulls", to be placed on same page but not interrupting main
flow. (n)</li>

<li>Exclusions classed "narrow" share column with main text
flow. (n)</li>

<li>Exclusions classed "wide" are placed in a separate full-page
column. (n)</li>

<li>Exclusions appear alternately at top/bottom of
page/column. (n)</li>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay,
brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle
and Environs.</p>

<p>Sir Tristram, violer d'amores, fr'over the short sea, had passencore
rearrived from North Armorica on this side the scraggy isthmus of
Europe Minor to wielderfight his penisolate war: nor had topsawyer's
rocks by the stream Oconee exaggerated themselse to Laurens County's
gorgios while they went doublin their mumper all the time: nor avoice
from afire bellowsed mishe mishe to tauftauf thuartpeatrick: not yet,
though venissoon after, had a kidscad buttended a bland old isaac: not
yet, though all's fair in vanessy, were sosie sesthers wroth with
twone nathandjoe.  Rot a peck of pa's malt had Jhem or Shen brewed by
arclight and rory end to the regginbrow was to be seen ringsome on the
aquaface.</p>

<p>The fall of a once wallstrait oldparr is retaled early in bed and
later on life down through all christian minstrelsy.  The great fall
of the offwall entailed at such short notice the pftjschute of
Finnegan, erse solid man, that the humptyhillhead of humself prumptly
sends an unquiring one well to the west in quest of his tumptytumtoes:
and their upturnpikepointandplace is at the knock out in the park
where oranges have been laid to rust upon the green since devlinsfirst
loved livvy.</p>

The oaks of ald now they lie in peat yet elms leap where askes lay.

<p>What clashes here of wills gen wonts, oystrygods gaggin fishygods!
Br&eacute;kkek K&eacute;kkek K&eacute;kkek K&eacute;kkek!  K&oacute;ax
K&oacute;ax K&oacute;ax!  Ualu Ualu Ualu!  Quaouauh!  Where the
Baddelaries partisans are still out to mathmaster Malachus Micgranes
and the Verdons catapelting the camibalistics out of the Whoyteboyce
of Hoodie Head.  Assiegates and boomeringstroms.  Sod's brood, be me
fear!  Sanglorians, save!  Arms apeal with larms, appalling.
Killykillkilly: a toll, a toll.  What chance cuddleys, what cashels
aired and ventilated!  What bidimetoloves sinduced by what
tegotetabsolvers!  What true feeling for their's hayair with what
strawng voice of false jiccup!  O here here how hoth sprowled met the
duskt the father of fornicationists but, (O my shining stars and
body!)  how hath fanespanned most high heaven the skysign of soft
advertisement!  But was iz?  Iseut?  Ere were sewers?  The oaks of ald
now they lie in peat yet elms leap where askes lay.  Phall if you but
will, rise you must: and none so soon either shall the pharce for the
nunce come to a setdown secular phoenish.</p>

<h2>Bygmester Finnegan</h2>

<p>Bygmester Finnegan, of the Stuttering Hand, freemen's maurer, lived in
the broadest way immarginable in his rushlit toofarback for messuages
before joshuan judges had given us numbers or Helviticus committed
deuteronomy (one yeastyday he sternely struxk his tete in a tub for to
watsch the future of his fates but ere he swiftly stook it out again,
by the might of moses, the very water was eviparated and all the
guenneses had met their exodus so that ought to show you what a
pentschanjeuchy chap he was!)  and during mighty odd years this man of
hod, cement and edifices in Toper's Thorp piled buildung supra
buildung pon the banks for the livers by the Soangso.</p>

<p>He addle liddle phifie Annie ugged the little craythur.  Wither
hayre in honds tuck up your part inher.  Oftwhile balbulous, mithre
ahead, with goodly trowel in grasp and ivoroiled overalls which he
habitacularly fondseed, like Haroun Childeric Eggeberth he would
caligulate by multiplicables the alltitude and malltitude until he
seesaw by neatlight of the liquor wheretwin 'twas born, his roundhead
staple of other days to rise in undress maisonry upstanded
(joygrantit!), a waalworth of a skyerscape of most eyeful hoyth
entowerly, erigenating from next to nothing and celescalating the
himals and all, hierarchitectitiptitoploftical, with a burning bush
abob off its baubletop and with larrons o'toolers clittering up and
tombles a'buckets clottering down.</p>

<p>Of the first was he to bare arms and a name: Wassaily Booslaeugh of
Riesengeborg.  His crest of huroldry, in vert with ancillars,
troublant, argent, a hegoak, poursuivant, horrid, horned.  His
scutschum fessed, with archers strung, helio, of the second.  Hootch
is for husbandman handling his hoe.  Hohohoho, Mister Finn, you're
going to be Mister Finnagain!  Comeday morm and, O, you're vine!
Sendday's eve and, ah, you're vinegar!  Hahahaha, Mister Funn, you're
going to be fined again!</p>

<p>What then agentlike brought about that tragoady thundersday this
municipal sin business?  Our cubehouse still rocks as earwitness to
the thunder of his arafatas but we hear also through successive ages
that shebby choruysh of unkalified muzzlenimiissilehims that would
blackguardise the whitestone ever hurtleturtled out of heaven.  Stay
us wherefore in our search for tighteousness, O Sustainer, what time
we rise and when we take up to toothmick and before we lump down upown
our leatherbed and in the night and at the fading of the stars!  For a
nod to the nabir is better than wink to the wabsanti.  Otherways
wesways like that provost scoffing bedoueen the jebel and the jpysian
sea.</p>

<p>Cropherb the crunchbracken shall decide.  Then we'll know if the
feast is a flyday.  She has a gift of seek on site and she allcasually
ansars helpers, the dreamydeary.  Heed!  Heed!  It may half been a
missfired brick, as some say, or it mought have been due to a
collupsus of his back promises, as others looked at it.  (There extand
by now one thousand and one stories, all told, of the same).  But so
sore did abe ite ivvy's holired abbles, (what with the wallhall's

<h2>The Fall</h2>

<p>His howd feeled heavy, his hoddit did shake.  (There was a wall of
course in erection) Dimb!  He stottered from the latter.  Damb!  he
was dud.  Dumb!  Mastabatoom, mastabadtomm, when a mon merries his
lute is all long.  For whole the world to see.</p>

<p>Shize?  I should shee!  Macool, Macool, orra whyi deed ye diie?  of a
trying thirstay mournin?  Sobs they sighdid at Fillagain's
chrissormiss wake, all the hoolivans of the nation, prostrated in
their consternation and their duodisimally profusive plethora of
ululation.  There was plumbs and grumes and cheriffs and citherers and
raiders and cinemen too.</p>

<p>And the all gianed in with the shoutmost shoviality.  Agog and
magog and the round of them agrog.  To the continuation of that
celebration until Hanandhunigan's extermination!  Some in kinkin
corass, more, kankan keening.  Belling him up and filling him down.
He's stiff but he's steady is Priam Olim!  'Twas he was the dacent
gaylabouring youth.</p>

<p>Sharpen his pillowscone, tap up his bier!  E'erawhere in this whorl
would ye hear sich a din again?  With their deepbrow fundigs and the
dusty fidelios.  They laid him brawdawn alanglast bed.  With a
bockalips of finisky fore his feet.  And a barrowload of guenesis hoer
his head.  Tee the tootal of the fluid hang the twoddle of the
fuddled, O!</p>

<p>Hurrah, there is but young gleve for the owl globe wheels in view
which is tautaulogically the same thing.  Well, Him a being so on the
flounder of his bulk like an overgrown babeling, let wee peep, see, at
Hom, well, see peegee ought he ought, platterplate.  Hum!  From
Shopalist to Bailywick or from ashtun to baronoath or from Buythebanks
to Roundthehead or from the foot of the bill to ireglint's eye he
calmly extensolies.  And all the way (a horn!)  from fiord to fjell
his baywinds' oboboes shall wail him rockbound (hoahoahoah!)  in
swimswamswum and all the livvylong night, the delldale dalppling
night, the night of bluerybells, her flittaflute in tricky trochees (O
carina!  O carina!)  wake him.</p>

<p>With her issavan essavans and her patterjackmartins about all them
inns and ouses.  Tilling a teel of a tum, telling a toll of a teary
turty Taubling.  Grace before Glutton.  For what we are, gifs a gross
if we are, about to believe.  So pool the begg and pass the kish for
crawsake.  Omen.  So sigh us.  Grampupus is fallen down but grinny
sprids the boord.  Whase on the joint of a desh?  Finfoefom the Fush.
Whase be his baken head?  A loaf of Singpantry's Kennedy bread.  And
whase hitched to the hop in his tayle?  A glass of Danu U'Dunnell's
foamous olde Dobbelin ayle.  But, lo, as you would quaffoff his
fraudstuff and sink teeth through that pyth of a flowerwhite bodey
behold of him as behemoth for he is noewhemoe.  Finiche!  Only a
fadograph of a yestern scene.  Almost rubicund Salmosalar, ancient
fromout the ages of the Agapemonides, he is smolten in our mist,
woebecanned and packt away.  So that meal's dead off for summan,
schlook, schlice and goodridhirring.</p>

<p>Yet may we not see still the brontoichthyan form outlined
aslumbered, even in our own nighttime by the sedge of the troutling
stream that Bronto loved and Brunto has a lean on.  Hiccubat edilis.
Apud libertinam parvulam.  Whatif she be in flags or flitters,
reekierags or sundyechosies, with a mint of mines or beggar a
pinnyweight.  Arrah, sure, we all love little Anny Ruiny, or, we mean
to say, lovelittle Anna Rayiny, when unda her brella, mid piddle med
puddle, she ninnygoes nannygoes nancing by.  Yoh!  Brontolone slaaps,
yoh snoores.</p>

<p>Upon Benn Heather, in Seeple Isout too.  The cranic head on him,
caster of his reasons, peer yuthner in yondmist.  Whooth?  His clay

<h2>Museum Tour</h2>

<p>Hence when the clouds roll by, jamey, a proudseye view is enjoyable

And such reasonable weather too!  The wagrant wind's awalt'zaround the

<p>His glav toside him.
Skud ontorsed.  Our pigeons pair are flewn for northcliffs.  The three

kvarters of that sky whence triboos answer; Wail, 'tis well!  She
niver comes out when Thon's on shower or when Thon's flash with his
Nixy girls or when Thon's blowing toomcracks down the gaels of Thon.
No nubo no!  Neblas on you liv!  Her would be too moochy afreet.  Of
Burymeleg and Bindmerollingeyes and all the deed in the woe.  Fe fo
fom!  She jist does hopes till byes will be byes.  Here, and it goes
on to appear now, she comes, a peacefugle, a parody's bird, a peri
potmother, a pringlpik in the ilandiskippy, with peewee and powwows in
beggybaggy on her bickybacky and a flick flask fleckflinging its
pixylighting pacts' huemeramybows, picking here, pecking there,
pussypussy plunderpussy.  But it's the armitides toonigh, militopucos,
and toomourn we wish for a muddy kissmans to the minutia workers and
there's to be a gorgeups truce for happinest childher everwere.</p>

<p>Come
nebo me and suso sing the day we sallybright.  She's burrowed the
coacher's headlight the better to pry (who goes cute goes siocur and
shoos aroun) and all spoiled goods go into her nabsack: curtrages and
rattlin buttins, nappy spattees and flasks of all nations, clavicures
and scampulars, maps, keys and woodpiles of haypennies and moonled
brooches with bloodstaned breeks in em, boaston nightgarters and
masses of shoesets and nickelly nacks and foder allmicheal and a lugly
parson of cates and howitzer muchears and midgers and maggets, ills
and ells with loffs of toffs and pleures of bells and the last sigh
that come fro the hart (bucklied!)  and the fairest sin the sunsaw
(that's cearc!).  With Kiss.  Kiss Criss.  Cross Criss.  Kiss Cross.
Undo lives 'end.  Slain.</p>

<p>How bootifull and how truetowife of her, when strengly forebidden, to
steal our historic presents from the past postpropheticals so as to
will make us all lordyheirs and ladymaidesses of a pretty nice kettle
of fruit.  She is livving in our midst of debt and laffing through all
plores for us (her birth is uncontrollable), with a naperon for her
mask and her sabboes kickin arias (so sair!  so solly!)  if yous ask
me and I saack you.  Hou!  Hou!  Gricks may rise and Troysirs fall
(there being two sights for ever a picture) for in the byways of high
improvidence that's what makes lifework leaving and the world's a cell
for citters to cit in.  Let young wimman run away with the story and
let young min talk smooth behind the butteler's back.  She knows her
knight's duty while Luntum sleeps.</p>

<p>Did ye save any tin?  says he.
Did I what?  with a grin says she.  And we all like a marriedann
because she is mercenary.  Though the length of the land lies under
liquidation (floote!)  and there's nare a hairbrow nor an eyebush on
this glaubrous phace of Herrschuft Whatarwelter she'll loan a vesta
and hire some peat and sarch the shores her cockles to heat and she'll
do all a turfwoman can to piff the business on.  Paff.  To puff the
blaziness on.  Poffpoff.</p>

<p>And even if Humpty shell fall frumpty times as awkward again in the
beardsboosoloom of all our grand remonstrancers there'll be iggs for
the brekkers come to mournhim, sunny side up with care.  So true is it
that therewhere's a turnover the tay is wet too and when you think you
ketch sight of a hind make sure but you're cocked by a hin.</p>

<p>Then as she is on her behaviourite job of quainance bandy, fruting for
firstlings and taking her tithe, we may take our review of the two
mounds to see nothing of the himples here as at elsewhere, by sixes
and sevens, like so many heegills and collines, sitton aroont,
scentbreeched ant somepotreek, in their swishawish satins and their
taffetaffe tights, playing Wharton's Folly, at a treepurty on the
planko in the purk.  Stand up, mickos!  Make strake for minnas!  By
order, Nicholas Proud.  We may see and hear nothing if we choose of
the shortlegged bergins off Corkhill or the bergamoors of Arbourhill
or the bergagambols of Summerhill or the bergincellies of Miseryhill
or the countrybossed bergones of Constitutionhill though every crowd
has its several tones and every trade has its clever mechanics and
each harmonical has a point of its own, Olaf's on the rise and Ivor's
on the lift and Sitric's place's between them.  But all they are all
there scraping along to sneeze out a likelihood that will solve and
salve life's robulous rebus, hopping round his middle like kippers on
a griddle, O, as he lays dormont from the macroborg of Holdhard to the
microbirg of Pied de Poudre.  Behove this sound of Irish sense.
Really?  Here English might be seen.  Royally?  One sovereign punned
to petery pence.  Regally?  The silence speaks the scene.  Fake!</p>

<p>Somewhere, parently, in the ginnandgo gap between antediluvious and
annadominant the copyist must have fled with his scroll.  The billy
flood rose or an elk charged him or the sultrup worldwright from the
excelsissimost empyrean (bolt, in sum) earthspake or the Dannamen
gallous banged pan the bliddy duran.  A scribicide then and there is
led off under old's code with some fine covered by six marks or
ninepins in metalmen for the sake of his labour's dross while it will
be only now and again in our rear of o'er era, as an upshoot of
military and civil engagements, that a gynecure was let on to the
scuffold for taking that same fine sum covertly by meddlement with the
drawers of his neighbour's safe.</p>

<p>Now after all that farfatch'd and peragrine or dingnant or clere lift
we our ears, eyes of the darkness, from the tome of Liber Lividus and,
(toh!), how paisibly eirenical, all dimmering dunes and gloamering

<p>Thus, too, for
donkey's years.  Since the bouts of Hebear and Hairyman the
cornflowers have been staying at Ballymun, the duskrose has choosed
out Goatstown's hedges, twolips have pressed togatherthem by sweet
Rush, townland of twinedlights, the whitethorn and the redthorn have
fairygeyed the mayvalleys of Knockmaroon, and, though for rings round
them, during a chiliad of perihelygangs, the Formoreans have brittled
the tooath of the Danes and the Oxman has been pestered by the
Firebugs and the Joynts have thrown up jerrybuilding to the Kevanses
and Little on the Green is childsfather to the City (Year!  Year!  And

<h2>The Prankquean</h2>

<p>It was of a night, late, lang time agone, in an auldstane eld, when
Adam was delvin and his madameen spinning watersilts, when mulk
mountynotty man was everybully and the first leal ribberrobber that
ever had her ainway everybuddy to his lovesaking eyes and everybilly
lived alove with everybiddy else, and Jarl van Hoother had his burnt
head high up in his lamphouse, laying cold hands on himself.  And his
two little jiminies, cousins of ourn, Tristopher and Hilary, were
kickaheeling their dummy on the oil cloth flure of his homerigh,
castle and earthenhouse.  And, be dermot, who come to the keep of his
inn only the nieceof-his-in-law, the prankquean.</p>

<p>And the prankquean pulled a rosy one and made her wit foreninst the
dour.  And she lit up and fireland was ablaze.  And spoke she to the
dour in her petty perusienne: Mark the Wans, why do I am alook alike a
poss of porterpease?  And that was how the skirtmisshes began.  But
the dour handworded her grace in dootch nossow: Shut!  So her grace
o'malice kidsnapped up the jiminy Tristopher and into the shandy
westerness she rain, rain, rain.  And Jarl van Hoother warlessed after
her with soft dovesgall: Stop deef stop come back to my earin stop.
But she swaradid to him: Unlikelihud.  And there was a brannewail that
same sabboath night of falling angles somewhere in Erio.</p>

<p>And the
prankquean went for her forty years' walk in Tourlemonde and she
washed the blessings of the lovespots off the jiminy with soap
sulliver suddles and she had her four owlers masters for to tauch him
his tickles and she convorted him to the onesure allgood and he became
a luderman.  So then she started to rain and to rain and, be redtom,
she was back again at Jarl van Hoother's in a brace of samers and the
jiminy with her in her pinafrond, lace at night, at another time.  And
where did she come but to the bar of his bristolry.  And Jarl von
Hoother had his baretholobruised heels drowned in his cellarmalt,
shaking warm hands with himself and the jimminy Hilary and the dummy
in their first infancy were below on the tearsheet, wringing and
coughing, like brodar and histher.  And the prankquean nipped a paly
one and lit up again and redcocks flew flackering from the hillcombs.
And she made her witter before the wicked, saying: Mark the Twy, why
do I am alook alike two poss of porterpease?  And: Shut!  says the
wicked, handwording her madesty.  So her madesty aforethought set down
a jiminy and took up a jiminy and all the lilipath ways to Woeman's
Land she rain, rain, rain.  And Jarl von Hoother bleethered atter her
with a loud finegale: Stop domb stop come back with my earring stop.
But the prankquean swaradid: Am liking it.</p>

<p>And there was a wild old
grannewwail that laurency night of starshootings somewhere in Erio.
And the prankquean went for her forty years' walk in Turnlemeem and
she punched the curses of cromcruwell with the nail of a top into the
jiminy and she had her four larksical monitrix to touch him his tears
and she provorted him to the onecertain allsecure and he became a
tristian.  So then she started raining, raining, and in a pair of
changers, be dom ter, she was back again at Jarl von Hoother's and the
Larryhill with her under her abromette.</p>

<p>And why would she halt at all
if not by the ward of his mansionhome of another nice lace for the
third charm?  And Jarl von Hoother had his hurricane hips up to his
pantrybox, ruminating in his holdfour stomachs (Dare!  O dare!), and
the jiminy Toughertrees and the dummy were belove on the watercloth,
kissing and spitting, and roguing and poghuing, like knavepaltry and
naivebride and in their second infancy.  And the prankquean picked a
blank and lit out and the valleys lay twinkling.  And she made her
wittest in front of the arkway of trihump, asking: Mark the Tris, why
do I am alook alike three poss of porter pease?  But that was how the
skirtmishes endupped.</p>

<p>For like the campbells acoming with a fork
lance of lightning, Jarl von Hoother Boanerges himself, the old terror
of the dames, came hip hop handihap out through the pikeopened arkway
of his three shuttoned castles, in his broadginger hat and his civic
chollar and his allabuff hemmed and his bullbraggin soxangloves and
his ladbroke breeks and his cattegut bandolair and his fur23 UP framed
panuncular cumbottes like a rudd yellan gruebleen orangeman in his
violet indigonation, to the whole longth of the strongth of his
bowman's bill.  And he clopped his rude hand to his eacy hitch and he
ordurd and his thick spch spck for her to shut up shop, dappy.  And
the duppy shot the shutter clup And they all drank free.</p>

<aside>And that was the first peace of illiterative porthery in all
the flamend floody flatuous world. ~~~</aside>

<p>For one man in his armour was a fat match always for any girls
under shurts.  And that was the first peace of illiterative porthery
in all the flamend floody flatuous world.  How kirssy the tiler made a
sweet unclose to the Narwhealian captol.  Saw fore shalt thou sea.
Betoun ye and be.  The prankquean was to hold her dummyship and the
jimminies was to keep the peacewave and van Hoother was to git the
wind up.  Thus the hearsomeness of the burger felicitates the whole of
the polis.</p>

<h2>O foenix culprit!</h2>

louthly one whose loab we are devorers of, how butt for his hold

<p>He dug in and dug out by the skill of his tilth for himself and all
belonging to him and he sweated his crew beneath his auspice for the

<p>Now be aisy, good Mr Finnimore, sir.  And take your laysure like a god
on pension and don't be walking abroad.  Sure you'd only lose yourself
in Healiopolis now the way your roads in Kapelavaster are that winding
there after the calvary, the North Umbrian and the Fivs Barrow and
Waddlings Raid and the Bower Moore and wet your feet maybe with the
foggy dew's abroad.  Meeting some sick old bankrupt or the Cottericks'
donkey with his shoe hanging, clankatachankata, or a slut snoring with
an impure infant on a bench.</p>

<p>'Twould turn you against life, so
'twould.  And the weather's that mean too.  To part from Devlin is

grievance.  You're better off, sir, where you are, primesigned in the

amberulla, the whole treasure of the pyre, in the land of souls with
Homin and Broin Baroke and pole ole Lonan and Nobucketnozzler and the
Guinnghis Khan.  And we'll be coming here, the ombre players, to rake

isn't our spittle we'll stint you of, is it, druids?  Not shabbty
little imagettes, pennydirts and dodgemyeyes you buy in the soottee
stores.</p>

<p>But offerings of the field.  Mieliodories, that Doctor
Faherty, the madison man, taught to gooden you.  Poppypap's a passport
out.  And honey is the holiest thing ever was, hive, comb and earwax,
the food for glory, (mind you keep the pot or your nectar cup may
yield too light!)  and some goat's milk, sir, like the maid used to
bring you.  Your fame is spreading like Basilico's ointment since the
Fintan Lalors piped you overborder and there's whole households beyond
the Bothnians and they calling names after you.  The menhere's always
talking of you sitting around on the pig's cheeks under the sacred

of the work of thy tombing.  Howe of the shipmen, steep wall!</p>

<p>Everything's going on the same or so it appeals to all of us, in the
old holmsted here.  Coughings all over the sanctuary, bad scrant to me
aunt Florenza.  The horn for breakfast, one o'gong for lunch and
dinnerchime.  As popular as when Belly the First was keng and his
members met in the Diet of Man.  The same shop slop in the window.
Jacob's lettercrackers and Dr Tipple's Vi-Cocoa and the Eswuards'
desippated soup beside Mother Seagull's syrup.  Meat took a drop when
Reilly-Parsons failed.  Coal's short but we've plenty of bog in the
yard.  And barley's up again, begrained to it.  The lads is attending
school nessans regular, sir, spelling beesknees with hathatansy and
turning out tables by mudapplication.</p>

<p>Allfor the books and never
pegging smashers after Tom Bowe Glassarse or Timmy the Tosser.
'Tisraely the truth!  No isn't it, roman pathoricks?  You were the
doublejoynted janitor the morning they were delivered and you'll be a
grandfer yet entirely when the ritehand seizes what the lovearm knows.
Kevin's just a doat with his cherub cheek, chalking oghres on walls,
and his little lamp and schoolbelt and bag of knicks, playing
postman's knock round the diggings and if the seep were milk you could
lieve his olde by his ide but, laus sake, the devil does be in that
knirps of a Jerry sometimes, the tarandtan plaidboy, making encostive
inkum out of the last of his lavings and writing a blue streak over
his bourseday shirt.</p>

<p>Hetty Jane's a child of Mary.  She'll be coming (for they're sure
to choose her) in her white of gold with a tourch of ivy to rekindle
the flame on Felix Day.  But Essie Shanahan has let down her skirts.
You remember Essie in our Luna's Convent?  They called her Holly Merry
her lips were so ruddyberry and Pia de Purebelle when the redminers
riots was on about her.  Were I a clerk designate to the
Williamswoodsmenufactors I'd poster those pouters on every jamb in the
town.  She's making her rep at Lanner's twicenightly.  With the
tabarine tamtammers of the whirligigmagees.  Beats that cachucha flat.
'Twould dilate your heart to go.</p>

<p>Aisy now, you decent man, with your knees and lie quiet and repose
your honour's lordship!  Hold him here, Ezekiel Irons, and may God
strengthen you!  It's our warm spirits, boys, he's spooring.
Dimitrius O'Flagonan, cork that cure for the Clancartys!  You swamped
enough since Portobello to float the Pomeroy.  Fetch neahere, Pat Koy!
And fetch nouyou, Pam Yates!  Be nayther angst of Wramawitch!  Here's
lumbos.  Where misties swaddlum, where misches lodge none, where
mystries pour kind on, O sleepy!  So be yet!</p>

<p>I've an eye on queer Behan and old Kate and the butter, trust me.
She'll do no jugglywuggly with her war souvenir postcards to help to
build me murial, tippers!  I'll trip your traps!  Assure a sure there!
And we put on your clock again, sir, for you.  Did or didn't we,
sharestutterers?  So you won't be up a stump entirely.  Nor shed your
remnants.  The sternwheel's crawling strong.  I seen your missus in
the hall.  Like the queenoveire.  Arrah, it's herself that's fine,
too, don't be talking!  Shirksends?  You storyan Harry chap longa me
Harry chap storyan grass woman plelthy good trout.  Shakeshands.
Dibble a hayfork's wrong with her only her lex's salig.  Boald Tib
does be yawning and smirking cat's hours on the Pollockses' woolly
round tabouretcushion watching her sewing a dream together, the
tailor's daughter, stitch to her last.</p>

<p>Or while waiting for winter to fire the enchantement, decoying more
nesters to fall down the flue.  It's allavalonche that blows nopussy
food.  If you only were there to explain the meaning, best of men, and
talk to her nice of guldenselver.  The lips would moisten once again.
As when you drove with her to Findrinny Fair.  What with reins here
and ribbons there all your hands were employed so she never knew was
she on land or at sea or swooped through the blue like Airwinger's
bride.  She was flirtsome then and she's fluttersome yet.  She can
second a song and adores a scandal when the last post's gone by.  Fond
of a concertina and pairs passing when she's had her forty winks for
supper after kanekannan and abbely dimpling and is in her merlin chair
assotted, reading her Evening World.  To see is it smarts, full
lengths or swaggers.  News, news, all the news.</p>

Death, a leopard, kills fellah in Fez.  Angry scenes at Stormount.

Stilla Star with her lucky in goingaways.  Opportunity fair with the
China floods and we hear these rosy rumours.  Ding Tams he noise about
all same Harry chap.</p>

<p>She's seeking her way, a chickle a chuckle, in and out of their
serial story, Les Loves of Selskar et Pervenche, freely adapted to The
Novvergin's Viv.  There'll be bluebells blowing in salty sepulchres
the night she signs her final tear.  Zee End.  But that's a world of
ways away.  Till track laws time.  No silver ash or switches for that
one!  While flattering candles flare.  Anna Stacey's how are you!
Worther waist in the noblest, says Adams and Sons, the wouldpay
actionneers.  Her hair's as brown as ever it was.  And wivvy and wavy.
Repose you now!  Finn no more!</p>

<p>For, be that samesake sibsubstitute of a hooky salmon, there's
already a big rody ram lad at random on the premises of his haunt of
the hungred bordles, as it is told me.  Shop Illicit, flourishing like
a lordmajor or a buaboabaybohm, litting flop a deadlop (aloose!)  to
lee but lifting a bennbranch a yardalong (Ivoeh!)  the breezy side
(for showm!), the height of Brewster's chimpney and as broad below as
Phineas Barnum; humphing his share of the showthers is senken on him
he's such a grandfallar, with a pocked wife in pickle that's a flyfire
and three lice nittle clinkers, two twilling bugs and one midgit
pucelle.</p>

<p>And aither he cursed and recursed and was everseen doing what your
fourfootlers saw or he was never done seeing what you coolpigeons
know, weep the clouds aboon for smiledown witnesses, and that'll do
now about the fairyhees and the frailyshees.  Though Eset fibble it to
the zephiroth and Artsa zoom it round her heavens for ever. Creator he
has created for his creatured ones a creation.  White monothoid?  Red
theatrocrat?  And all the pinkprophets cohalething?  Very much so!
But however 'twas 'tis sure for one thing, what sherif Toragh
voucherfors and Mapqiq makes put out, that the man, Humme the
Cheapner, Esc, overseen as we thought him, yet a worthy of the naym,
came at this timecoloured place where we live in our paroqial
fermament one tide on another, with a bumrush in a hull of a wherry,
the twin turbane dhow, The Bey for Dybbling, this archipelago's first
visiting schooner, with a wicklowpattern waxenwench at her prow for a
figurehead, the deadsea dugong updipdripping from his depths, and has
been repreaching himself like a fishmummer these siktyten years ever
since, his shebi by his shide, adi and aid, growing hoarish under his
turban and changing cane sugar into sethulose starch (Tuttut's cess to
him!)  as also that, batin the bulkihood he bloats about when
innebbiated, our old offender was humile, commune and ensectuous from
his nature, which you may gauge after the bynames was put under him,
in lashons of languages, (honnein suit and praisers be!)  and,
totalisating him, even hamissim of himashim that he, sober serious, he
is ee and no counter he who will be ultimendly respunchable for the
hubbub caused in Edenborough.</p>
