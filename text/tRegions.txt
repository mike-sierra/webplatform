Note: The proposed syntax for CSS Regions and CSS Exclusions has
changed since this article was written, though the concepts remain the
same. Please check the CSS Regions W3C Working Draft and the CSS
Exclusions and Shapes W3C Working Draft for up-to-date details.

The web has become a rich repository of content for reference and
educational materials, news, articles, and interactive apps. However,
some of the capabilities that are taken for granted when designing
content for print are still impossible or very difficult to implement
using web standards.

Print publications are exploring better ways of translating and
adapting their content to a rich digital format. We see this as an
opportunity to make the web more expressive and to support more
sophisticated layouts.

Adobe has been experimenting with some improvements to CSS to express
the kind of complex layouts used by traditional magazines. We have
submitted some proposals to the W3C CSS Working Group, and last year
built a prototype implementation of these proposals using WebKit. We
made the prototype available from Adobe Labs for people to try out.

Since then, we have started to contribute the CSS Regions feature to
the WebKit project mainline. The features are starting to be available
in nightly builds of WebKit and Chromium, as described on the
html.adobe.com web site for regions. The CSS Exclusions features are
in progress, but not available yet in production WebKit browsers.

You can find the W3C Editor's drafts on the CSS Regions Module and the
CSS Exclusions Module pages on the W3C website. Discussions on these
proposals take place on the W3C CSS mailing list. You are welcome to
send comments to this public mailing list. Please include
"[css3-regions]" or "[css3-exclusions]" in your message's subject.

A few caveats: This is a work in progress. As we continue the
discussion with the broader community, we will be making some
changes. The syntax used in this article reflects the state of the
current W3C Working Drafts, but as it did in the past year it may
continue to evolve as the discussions in the W3C CSS working group and
with the broader community proceed. Note also that, in accordance with
common practice, all the new proposed properties are prefixed with
"-webkit-" in the WebKit prototype and main line implementation. For
the sake of simplicity, I have omitted this prefix in the rest of the
article.

Now, let's dive into the proposed extensions. They can be divided into
four categories:

Threading content: Content that flows from one area to another.

Arbitrarily shaped containers: Text displayed in non-rectangular
areas.

Arbitrarily shaped exclusions: Text can wrap around arbitrary shapes.

Region styling: Styling content depending on the area in which it
flows.

Below are some simple examples of each.

Content flow

In a typical HTML document, text can be displayed in multiple regions,
but the text in each of those regions is independent (see Figure
1). If you wanted to display text across multiple columns or use
other, more complex, arrangements of areas, you would need to fit the
text in each region manually. This would not work very well when users
magnify the text, or even if they have different fonts on their
systems than the ones you specified. This approach also makes it
impossible to have fluid layouts that adapt when the window is
resized, or, when displaying content on a tablet, adapt to portrait
and landscape orientations.

Figure 1. Text displayed across three columns of different widths.

What if you could specify separately a thread of content (like text
and images), and how that thread should flow across a chain of
regions? This is what content flow does.

To use it, give a name to a thread by using the proposed flow-into CSS
property to the region that contains the content. Doing so will remove
the content from the normal CSS layout flow. You can then insert this
thread into one or more other regions by using the flow-from property.

The markup for the three-column example above would look something
like this:

CSS
    #source {
       flow-into: main-thread;
    }

    .region {
        flow-from: main-thread;
        background: #C5DFF0;
    }

HTML
    <div id="source">
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor [...]</p>
    </div>
    <div id="region1" class="region"></div>
    <div id="region2" class="region"></div>
    <div id="region3" class="region"></div>

You can combine multiple named flows on a single page.

With this simple building block, you can represent more complex
layouts, including multiple columns of text, columns of different
width and height, and regions that span multiple columns (see Figure
2).

Wrap shape

With wrap shape, you can control the shape of the region into which
text is flowed (see Figure 3). You can use this property in
conjunction with, or independently from, content flow to create more
interesting designs.

Figure 3. Text content flowing inside custom shapes.

To use this feature, you need to set the shape-inside property to the
desired value.

The markup to display the heart-shape text above would look like this:

CSS

.circle{
        /* shape the element as a circle */
        shape-inside: polygon(0px, 150px /* ...more points */);

}

.heart{
        /* shape the element as a heart */
        shape-inside: polygon(150px, 32px /* ...more points */);

}

HTML

<div class="circle"></div>

<div class="heart"></div>

The specification allows supports specifying a shape using a simple
polygon, rectangles, circles and ellipses, but you can also reference
arbitrary SVG shapes.

Exclusions

By using the shape-outside property, you can specify the shape that
should be interpreted as an area to be avoided altogether (see Figure
4).

Figure 4. Text flowing around custom shapes.

CSS
    .exclusion{
        /* flow text around this element */
        shape-outside: polygon(…);
    }

HTML
    <div class="exclusion circle">
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor [...]</p>
    </div>

Region styling

It is common in magazine articles to assign a different style to
content flowing through a particular area of the design. We are
calling this region styling. The example shows that text flowing in
the first region (which includes the "Introduction" header) is made
dark blue, whereas the rest of the text is gray (see Figure 5).

Figure 5. Text style depends on the region it flows into.

CSS
   p {
       color: gray:
   }
   @region-style #region_1 {
       p {
           color: #0C3D5F;
       }
   }

HTML
    <div id="article">
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>This is an example [...]</p>
    </div>
    <div id="region_1"></div>
    <div id="region_2"></div>
    <div id="region_3"></div>
    <div id="region_4"></div>

Region styling is now implemented in the WebKit nightly builds for the
background and color properties.

Additional details on the features described so far are available on
the CSS Regions page of html.adobe.com, and you can experiment with
them using nightly builds of WebKit or Chromium.

CSS3 regions and media queries

Those basic building blocks can be combined to create more interesting
and complex layouts, similar to what you are used to seeing in a print
publication. You can also combine these with other web standards. For
example, by using these features in combination with CSS media
queries, you can build layouts that can adapt to different device
orientations, portrait and landscape.

Figure 6 shows using the shape-inside property in combination with
CSS3 media queries to have a layout that adapts to different
orientations.

media queries to have a layout that adapts to different orientations

Figure 7 shows how the same content can be authored to adapt to
different orientations, including varying the number of columns.

CSS3 regions and JavaScript

You can also combine these capabilities with JavaScript to create
interactive content. In the example shown in Figure 8, you can slide
the double arrow to pan around and reveal more of the image. As you do
this, the text reflows around the shape of the mountains and the car.

The three examples above are included in the prototype you can
download from the CSS Exclusions page on html.adobe.com but note that
the examples use an older syntax from previous drafts of the CSS
Regions and CSS Exclusions modules. Once these particular examples run
in WebKit we will release them with updated syntax. I invite you to
download it to try it out for yourself. I'm really looking forward to
see the creative ideas you will be inspired to build with our
proposal, and I'm looking forward to working with you to build a
better web.
