== 3. Region flow break properties: ‘break-before’, ‘break-after’,
‘break-inside’ ==

User agents laying out content in multiple regions must determine
where content breaks occur. The problem of breaking content into
fragments fitting in regions is similar to breaking content into pages
or columns.

Each break ends layout in the current region and causes remaining
pieces of content from the named flow to be visually formatted in the
following region in the region chain, if there is one.

The following extends the ‘break-before’, ‘break-after’ and
‘break-inside’ properties from the [CSS3COL] specification to account
for regions. The additional values are described below.

Name: break-before

Value: auto | always | avoid | left | right | page | column | region |
avoid-page | avoid-column | avoid-region

Initial: auto

Applies to: block-level elements

Inherited: no

Percentages: N/A

Media: visual

Computed value: specified value

Name: break-after

Value: auto | always | avoid | left | right | page | column | region |
avoid-page | avoid-column | avoid-region

Initial: auto

Applies to: block-level elements

Inherited: no

Percentages: N/A

Media: visual

Computed value: specified value

Name: break-inside

Value: auto | avoid | avoid-page | avoid-column | avoid-region

Initial: auto

Applies to: block-level elements

Inherited: no

Percentages: N/A

Media: visual

Computed value: specified value

These properties describe page, column and region break behavior
before/after/inside the generated box. These values are normatively
defined in [CSS3COL]:

This specification adds the following new values:

region

Always force a region break before (after) the generated box.

avoid-region

Avoid a region break before (after, inside) the generated box.

The behavior of region breaks with regards to regions is identical to
the behavior of page breaks with regards to pages, as defined in the
[CSS21].
