== RegionFragment ==

== 3.4. The region-fragment property ==

Name: region-fragment

Value: auto | break

Initial: auto

Applies to: CSS Regions

Inherited: no

Percentages: N/A

Media: visual

Computed value: specified value

The ‘region-fragment’ property controls the behavior of the last
region associated with a named flow.

auto

Content flows as it would in a regular content box. If the content
exceeds the container box, it is subject to the overflow property's
computed value on the CSS Region. Region breaks must be ignored on the
last region.

break

If the content fits within the CSS Region, then this property has no
effect. If the content does not fit within the CSS Region, the content
breaks as if flow was going to continue in a subsequent region. See
the breaking rules section. A forced region break takes precedence
over a natural break point.

Flow content that follows the last break in the last region is not
rendered.

The ‘region-fragment’ property does not influence the size of the
region it applies to.

The following code sample illustrates the usage of the
‘region-fragment’ property.

<style>

article {
  flow-into: "article";
}

#region_1, #region_2 {
  flow-from: article;
  region-fragment: break; /* or auto */
  overflow: visible; /* or hidden */
}

</style>

<article>...</article>

<div id="region_1"></div>

<div id="region_2"></div>

‘flow-into: "article"’ region_1 and region_2 ‘region-fragment: auto’

‘overflow:visible’

‘region-fragment: break’ ‘region-fragment: auto’

‘overflow:hidden’

Different values for the region-fragment property

Note

The ‘overflow’ property is honored on a region: if region content
overflows, such as the borders of elements on the last line, the
‘overflow’ property controls the visibility of the overflowing
content. See the ‘overflow’ property definition ([CSS21]).
