== RegionLayoutUpdate ==

== 6.4. Region flow layout events ==

NamedFlow objects are EventTargets which dispatch regionlayoutupdate
events when there is a possible layout change in their region
chain. The event is asynchronous, and fires in the same step of the
event loop [HTML5] as when MutationObservers [DOM] are invoked.

If region chain nesting occurs (the contents of a NamedFlow contains
regions for a different NamedFlow) then the regionlayoutupdate event
for the nested flow(s) must be dispatched before the
regionlayoutupdate event for the containing flow is dispatched.
